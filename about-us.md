Foiling Yacht Innovation is a club founded in late 2018 by students from [The University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz) with the **mission** to:

> ## Design, build and race a [foiling moth](http://www.moth-sailing.org)

We have made significant progress towards our mission, finalising the design of [our first boat](/boat-one) in 2020 with the construction of our first hull and foils to commence in 2021.
