## Design

### Hull Design

The design of Boat One began in late 2018. Aerodynamic optimisation was a significant focus for the team utilising both CFD and wind tunnel models. We have validated this design in Gömböc, the sailing simulator designed by [Emirates Team New Zealand](https://emirates-team-new-zealand.americascup.com) and was pivotal to their win in the 2017 America's Cup. Additionally, the composite layup of the hull has been designed using FEA tools to ensure a lightweight, optmised hull is produced.

### Foils Design

Our first set of foils took inspiration from existing designs, intended to reduce the time-to-water of our first boat, with the intent to subsequently design more advanced foils. The team has utilised numerous tools throughout their design, most notable being [XFOIL](https://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/xfoil/).

## Build

### Hull Build

The build began in 2019, with male plugs machined by our sponsor [Core Builders Composites](https://www.corebuilderscomposites.com). In 2020 female moulds were infused from these plugs, with numerous delays encountered during Covid-19 lockdowns. Hull construction will commence in 2021, utilising carbon fibre pre-preg kindly donated by our sponsor [Southern Spars](https://southernspars.com)

### Foils Build

Our foil moulds were machined during 2019 and 2020, with one traditional aluminum mould as well as three MDF moulds finished in fibreglass, an approach that we hope will help us to reduce cost and increase the rate we can innovate our foil designs. Construction of our foils is due to commence in 2021.

## Race

We opmistically look forward to completing our first boat in time for racing in 2022, and highly appeciate all of those who support us along the way.
