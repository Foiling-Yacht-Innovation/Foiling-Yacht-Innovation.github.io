The move to Alert Level 4 saw the team shift it's focus entirely back into design, as construction came to a halt. The team has done some incredibly cool projects which focused within two key priorities:

1. Undertaking detailed design of features for Boat One, to prevent future construction bottlenecks.
1. Enacting improvements to existing designs for Boat Two.

We have put together [a short magazine](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Eq07UE0KX02cjg60N5XzeUbJWUZLhkmm/view?usp=sharing) highlighting the work we have done throughout the lockdown.

As the University of Auckland begins to reopen, the Foiling Yacht Innovation team are looking forward to constructing and realising our designs once more. We're really excited to hear from our supporters, how you're faring, and whether there is anything we can do to help out.
